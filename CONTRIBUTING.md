# Welcome to the go-objectid contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

First, welcome to the go-objectid repository. This repository offers a package allowing true, unbounded ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER support in Golang with many convenient features and encoding/decoding support.  The goal of this package is to offer a means of avoiding the shortcomings of the "encoding/asn1" package in terms of OID support.
